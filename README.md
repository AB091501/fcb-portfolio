# Regex Tutorial: MATCHING AN HTML TAG 

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use a regular expression (regex) to match an HTML tag. HTML tags are fundamental elements in web development, and understanding how to match them using regex can be a powerful tool.

## Summary
Today I will be covering and breaking down the components of a regular expression used to match HTML tag. HTML tags are used to structure the content of a web page. They consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Matching HTML tags with regex can be useful for parsing and extracting data from web pages or validating HTML content.
/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

## Regex Components


### The HTML Tag Structure

An HTML tag has the following structure:
- An opening tag starts with < and ends with >.
- The closing tag starts with </ and ends with >.
For example, here is an HTML tag structure:
`<p>This HTML tags is considered as a paragraph.</p>`
In the example, `'<p>'` will be the opening tag, and `'</p>'` will be the closing tag.

### Matching HTML Tags with a Regex
To match HTML tags with a regex, we can use the following pattern:
/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/
- `'/^'` and `'$/'`: These are the start and end anchors. They ensure that the regex matches the entire string from the beginning to the end.
- `'<'` and `'>'`: These characters match the opening and closing angle brackets of HTML tags.                                 
- `' ([a-z]+)'`: This part matches the tag name. `'[a-z]+'` specifies that the tag name consists of one or more lowercase letters.
- `' ([^<]+)*'`: This section matches any attributes within the opening tag. `'[^<]+'` means it can match one or more characters that are not `'<'`.
- `' (?:> and <\/\1>|\s+\/>)'`: This part is more complex and handles the closing tag or self-closing tag of the HTML element.
     * `' (?:>'`: This part captures the closing `'>'` of the opening tag.
     * `' (.*)'`: This part captures the content between the opening and closing tags. It uses `'.* '` to match any characters (zero or more) between the tags.
     * `'<\/\1>'`: This part matches the corresponding closing tag using a backreference `'\1'`. The `'\1'` refers back to the captured tag name, ensuring that the opening and closing tags match.
     * `'|\s+\/>)'`: Alternatively, this part matches a self-closing tag with a space and a forward slash (e.g., `'<img />)'`.
